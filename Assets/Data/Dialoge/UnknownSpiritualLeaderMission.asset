  - The Silent One, a figure cloaked in shadow and ancient wisdom, gestures towards
    a crumbling stone. 'The spirits are restless. Their voices, once clear, are now
    faint whispers carried on the wind. To restore the balance, you must find the
    exaclibur, a relic of forgotten power, and god's blood, a token of unwavering
    devotion. Return these to me, and I will share the secrets held within the whispers.'
  - They often hide in the old ruins to the west. Be careful, they're dangerous.
    Bring her back safely, please.

  playerDescriptionOptions:
  - I understand. I'll find these items.@ The whispers... Can you tell me more about
    these items?@ Restless spirits? I'll see if this is worth my time.

  - Thank you, Silent One. This knowledge is invaluable.@ The whispers... what do
    they truly mean?@ Good. I'll put this to good use.@ Incredible! I've never seen
    anything like this!
  - Right. Well, that's that then.@ What's the catch? What's the real reward here?
  playerFinishedOptions:
  - The Silent One fades back into the shadows, leaving you to contemplate the ancient
    knowledge you have gained, a sense of peace settling over you.@ The Silent One's
    form dissolves into mist, leaving you with the reward and a lingering sense of
    unanswered questions. The whispers continue, but their meaning remains elusive.@

    applications of your newly acquired reward.

    I should be aware of?@ This is taking longer than I expected. Any shortcuts?@

    where to look?
